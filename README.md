##Makers Academy Week 9 Test


###Aim

The aim of this test was to further practice Rails by building an Yelp-style app.

I wanted to give the challenge a little twist : the focus was to be not on restaurant reviews, but meal reviews. How good or bad were individual dishes at a restaurant?

Users could search for restaurants near them, or add their favourite restaurants if they didnâ€™t already exist. Then, users have the power to add different meals to a restaurant, including details on its price, ingredients, and any dietary requirements it satisfied. Users could then rate each dish once based on their own experience of trying it. 

Given enough data had been stored in the application, users could not only search for restaurants near them, but could filter by highly-rated dishes within a certain mile radius, the types of food they were looking for, and also the top meals under specific dietary requirements, such as being vegan or dairy intolerant.
